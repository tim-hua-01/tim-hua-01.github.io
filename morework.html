<h3>More of my work history</h3>
     <p title = "Most industry economists have a PhD and I don't, buuuuut I think we did real economics at Walmart and my official title is Manager, Economist so I'm going with it. ">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a past life, I was an economist on <a href = "https://x.com/Econ_4_Everyone/status/1751028417733030316?s=20" target="_blank">Walmart's Economics Team</a> working with pricing and <a href ="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7167569798137147392?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7167569798137147392%29", target="_blank">Spark drivers</a>. I designed and executed complex (multi-treatment arms with possible spillover effects) experiments and applied causal machine learning methods such as <a href = 'https://econml.azurewebsites.net/' target="_blank">DoubleML</a> and <a href = 'https://grf-labs.github.io/grf/' target="_blank">generalized random forests</a>. I also used synthetic difference in differences and <a href = "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2021.1920957" target = "_blank">Chernozhukov et al. (2021)</a> standard errors for evaluating treatment effects for when only one unit was treated. During my internship in 2022, I came up with this graph-partitioning based method for grouping stores into clusters for a pricing experiment. As of August 2024, <a href = "https://www.theinformation.com/articles/grok-4-real-deal">AIs</a> are <i>almost</i> able to independently come up with the method when prompted. 
        <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I left in August 2023 because I was just really interested in AI safety. Like I would read papers and listen to <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV5gbOmHbjU">three hour long youtube videos</a> about transformers on the subway. I would go to the <a href = "https://maps.app.goo.gl/AtvsVUf2CvDbzBbB9">Brookfield place</a> food court after work and do <a href = "https://www.arena.education/curriculum">ARENA exercises.</a> At some point, I decided that I should at least try to make the thing I really enjoy the thing I work on all day. So I quit my job and moved to Berkeley without any specific opportunity lined up. I did some random interp projects got rejected by a bunch of things for four months, then got into MARS and AI safety camp, and now I'm at MATS. Right now there's a blob on the <a href="random.html">random page</a> for some AI safety content I would recommend for anyone interested in the field.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also still interested in economics, and will probably want to do some writing about the <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkI_rRd4mX8" target="_blank">economics of transformative AI</a> at some point.

    <p title = "s c h o o l">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I graduated from Middlebury College with a degree in Economics in May 2023. My senior thesis, <i><a href ="thethith.pdf" target="_blank">Fox News's Effect on Social and Moral Preferences,</a></i> won the <a href = "https://www.middlebury.edu/college/academics/economics/awards-and-honors", target="_blank">D.K. Smith Prize in Economics</a> for best thesis (and got <a href = 'https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=16459445646365308639&as_sdt=5,48&sciodt=0,48&hl=en'>cited by Ben Enke</a>). I spent my 2021-2022 academic year as a visiting undergraduate student at Harvard, where I worked as a research assistant for Professor <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/ang" target="_blank">Desmond Ang</a> investigating racial stereotypes in films by scraping data from <a href="https://tvtropes.org" target="_blank">TV Tropes</a>. I also took Econ 1011a, the college's advanced microeconomic theory class. To give future students a better idea of how economists use the methods we learned, I wrote starred sections in the <a href = "https://github.com/tim-hua-01/ECON-1011A-Textbook/blob/master/textbook.pdf" target="_blank">student-written textbook</a>. They explain several examples of models found in actual papers. Honestly I would love to teach an economic theory class where we exclusively look at econ models that have nothing to do with money, like how to implement <a href = "https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w31411/w31411.pdf", target="_blank">an optimal rain prayer strategy</a> to increase belief in religious authorities. I am still very interested in economics and recently took <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hS-Pu0gq22IwB9mWeig8Ui9kvUITgHj9eH3ik2zNVpo/edit?tab=t.0" target="_blank">a two-week course</a> in the economics of transformative AI.<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From June 2021 to May 2022, I worked on Professor <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/experts/carol-graham/" target="_blank">Carol Graham</a>'s team. Our paper exploring the conflicting reports of mental health during the pandemic from different surveys and the connections between well-being and deaths of despair can be found <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/despair-and-resilience-in-the-us-did-the-covid-pandemic-worsen-mental-health-outcomes/" target="_blank">here</a>. During the 2020-2021 academic year, I worked as a Research Assistant to Professor <a href="https://martinabel.net/" target="_blank">Martin Abel</a> on a <a href ="https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/15769/choice-over-payment-schemes-and-worker-effort">paper</a> studying how different payment schemes affect worker effort. I also completed a personal research project examining COVID-19 tweets by governors and health experts with Chris Kim, Zihan Zhang, and Professor Alex Lyford during my second semester at college (I took a gap semester, where I got started with my hobby of looking at <a href ="OldBooks.html">old books</a>). Our paper was published in the <a href="https://www.jsr.org/index.php/path/article/view/1171" target="_blank">Journal of Student Research</a>.
