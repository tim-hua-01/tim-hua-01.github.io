<p>Thesis: <a href = "thethith.pdf" target="_blank">Fox News's Effect on Social and Moral Preferences</a>. Winner of the D.K. Smith Prize in Economics for best thesis. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract: This paper examines how Fox News influences social and moral preferences: two crucial inputs in people's decision-making process. I conduct a survey among Americans aged 45 or older and use the variation in the channel positions of Fox News and MSNBC across different towns and cable providers as instruments. After confirming that these channel positions do not predict voting patterns before Fox started broadcasting, I find evidence that Fox shifted moral values to be more communal, some suggestive evidence that it decreased altruism and trust, and that Fox does not appear to affect negative reciprocity. In addition, these treatment effects are concentrated among those who did not vote for Bill Clinton or Bob Dole in the 1996 election. <br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this is a good paper, and I'm still proud of it. In retrospect though, I could've gone for something much more ambitious. I had this whole research agenda in mind exploring how media affects culture, which I define as a set of social preferences (e.g., how much to trust others, how much to value family members over strangers) and constraints (I think economists don't seriously model social constraints and norms). I wrote this Fox News paper because it was a concrete example of how media could've changed people's preferences, there was an existing instrument with an <a href = "https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20160812", target="_blank">AER paper</a>, and it's a very standard economics paper where I could showcase my economics skills for grad school. <br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of trying to write "a great economics paper," I should've just tried to do the real thing and come up with, maybe not a grand theory, but at the minimum a set of interesting observations on how culture interacts with media. The final paper will probably be a bunch of vignettes, with lots of qualitative stories, maybe a few quantitative regressions, and some theory. It would've been a weird thesis, but I would get to study the real, core thing I actually really wanted to study, and that would've been better for my soul. Alas, it is not so, but I'm still quite happy with getting a citation from <a href = "https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-economics-091223-093730">Ben Enke</a> :)

<p>Empirical: The Link Between Survey Response Rates and Nonresponse Bias: Theory, Simulations, and Empirical Evidence From the Household Pulse Survey<br>
    THIS PAPER IS TOTALLY COOKED DONT READ IT MAN
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was inspired by the work I had done <a href = "https://www.brookings.edu/research/despair-and-resilience-in-the-us-did-the-covid-pandemic-worsen-mental-health-outcomes/" target="_blank">at Brookings</a>, where we found out about how the Household Pulse Survey is a <i>really terrible survey.</i> I was thinking about what the empirical relationship I see in the data between response rates and depression would be if there is nonresponse bias and realized that the answer is not immediately obvious. So I put on my theorist hat, drew upon my<a href = "https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2006/9/15/economics-1011a-microeconomic-theory-economics-1011a/" target="_blank"> Ec 1011a</a> knowledge, and wrote down a model for response rates and nonresponse bias, which eventually developed into this paper. Essentially, if one group has a higher response rate than the other group, and group membership changes, then the response rate will change in a way that reveals the sign of the nonresponse bias. For example, if unemployed individuals are more likely to respond to a survey and unemployment increases, then holding all else equal response rates will increase as well.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took the paper offline because there was a mistake in the proof of lemma one. Essentially, I thought that my estimator was unbiased when in reality is it only consistent. That means that I have to rewrite a bunch of things, and I haven't gotten to that...

The class is about 2/3 microeconomic theory topics and 1/3 history of microeconomic theory.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to add some data component to the paper to test my model in practice, but now I fear I might never have the time for it. The gist is that you can look at the professions where people are <a href = 'https://web.archive.org/web/20221108140909/https://insurify.com/insights/most-popular-occupations-for-uber-lyft-drivers/'>most likely to drive for a gig company</a>, and then see if their wages increased proportional to the local market concentration (which people have measured using proprietary data <a href = 'https://jhr.uwpress.org/content/57/S/S200.short'>here</a>, although <a href = 'https://doi.org/10.1111/irel.12341' target="_blank">this article</a> is supposed to have some market level measures available to the public). Then the specification uses data on <a href = 'https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/115490/version/V3/view?path=/openicpsr/115490/fcr:versions/V3/build/output&type=folder' target="_blank">uber/lyft entry</a>. You could even run a triple differences by comparing those who had a 40 hour work week (i.e., probably not a lot of hours flexibility) with those who didn't.</p>
