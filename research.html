<p>Thesis: <a href = "thethith.pdf" target="_blank">Fox News's Effect on Social and Moral Preferences</a>. Winner of the D.K. Smith Prize in Economics for best thesis. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract: This paper examines how Fox News influences social and moral preferences: two crucial inputs in people's decision-making process. I conduct a survey among Americans aged 45 or older and use the variation in the channel positions of Fox News and MSNBC across different towns and cable providers as instruments. After confirming that these channel positions do not predict voting patterns before Fox started broadcasting, I find evidence that Fox shifted moral values to be more communal, some suggestive evidence that it decreased altruism and trust, and that Fox does not appear to affect negative reciprocity. In addition, these treatment effects are concentrated among those who did not vote for Bill Clinton or Bob Dole in the 1996 election.

<p>Empirical: The Link Between Survey Response Rates and Nonresponse Bias: Theory, Simulations, and Empirical Evidence From the Household Pulse Survey<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was inspired by the work I had done <a href = "https://www.brookings.edu/research/despair-and-resilience-in-the-us-did-the-covid-pandemic-worsen-mental-health-outcomes/" target="_blank">at Brookings</a>, where we found out about how the Household Pulse Survey is a <i>really terrible survey.</i> I was thinking about what the empirical relationship I see in the data between response rates and depression would be if there is nonresponse bias and realized that the answer is not immediately obvious. So I put on my theorist hat, drew upon my<a href = "https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2006/9/15/economics-1011a-microeconomic-theory-economics-1011a/" target="_blank"> Ec 1011a</a> knowledge, and wrote down a model for response rates and nonresponse bias, which eventually developed into this paper. Essentially, if one group has a higher response rate than the other group, and group membership changes, then the response rate will change in a way that reveals the sign of the nonresponse bias. For example, if unemployed individuals are more likely to respond to a survey and unemployment increases, then holding all else equal response rates will increase as well.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took the paper offline because there was a mistake in the proof of lemma one. Essentially, I thought that my estimator was unbiased when in reality is it only consistent. That means that I have to rewrite a bunch of things, and I haven't gotten to that...

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to add some data component to the paper to test my model in practice, but now I fear I might never have the time for it. The gist is that you can look at the professions where people are <a href = 'https://web.archive.org/web/20221108140909/https://insurify.com/insights/most-popular-occupations-for-uber-lyft-drivers/'>most likely to drive for a gig company</a>, and then see if their wages increased proportional to the local market concentration (which people have measured using proprietary data <a href = 'https://jhr.uwpress.org/content/57/S/S200.short'>here</a>, although <a href = 'https://doi.org/10.1111/irel.12341' target="_blank">this article</a> is supposed to have some market level measures available to the public). Then the specification uses data on <a href = 'https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/115490/version/V3/view?path=/openicpsr/115490/fcr:versions/V3/build/output&type=folder' target="_blank">uber/lyft entry</a>. You could even run a triple differences by comparing those who had a 40 hour work week (i.e., probably not a lot of hours flexibility) with those who didn't.</p>

    <b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Preliminary update:</i></b> I wrote this paper <i>before</i> I had taken econometrics, probability, or statistics. I wrote it before I really learned R. (Wild eh?) So the data analysis we conducted was somewhat limited. This is not necessarily a huge deal: we had a census of all tweets from the time period, so none of the findings are "wrong." However, in retrospect, there was a lot that I would have done differently. The biggest one among them being that I would have treated each individual user as a unit of observation, as opposed to pooling everything together by user category. <br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For now though, I present the following two randomization inference graphs on the rate at which Republican/Democrat governors mention death or masks in their COVID-19 related tweets. The graph on the left looks at the proportion of COVID-19 related tweets that contained words relating to death; the one on the right looks at the proportion of COVID-19 related tweets that contained the word "mask." We randomize the assignment of party labels. The p-values are 0.001667 and 0.013 respectively, suggesting that the difference between Democrat and Republican governors are, in one sense, statistically significant (i.e., Democrats mention deaths and masks more). For reference, a similar test with words relating to the economy yields a p-value of 0.883.

<p><b><i>Do Last Names Affect Solo-authoriship Rates in Economics? </i></b> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard from my professor that econ papers almost always list authors based on the alphabetical order of their last name, I thought that those with last names that start later in the alphabet might
    decide to solo-author more, so that they won't always be lost in the et al's. <br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pulled data from Web of Science for every article published in the top five in the past ten years (n = 4680) and looked at the distribution of last names for 
    co and solo-authored papers. Turns out the difference in the mean last name (A = 1, B = 2, etc.) of authors involved in solo-authored v. coauthored is not that big: 11.57337 for solo authors and 
    11.36265 for co-authored. These numbers are calculated when I pooled all of the last names in all solo/co-authored papers together, and since this is a census of papers there are no confidence intervals to add. Here are the histograms for those last name pools:

<p> <b><i>A Productivity-Centered Theory of Time Allocation</i></b>  <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing models of time allocation focuses on a work-leisure trade-off subject to money and time constraints, where individuals need to consider both money and time when deciding between leisure, work, 
    and buying/making at home. I feel like this 
    really doesn't apply to a lot of people. This is especially true given that nowadays, a lot of leisure (Disney+, video games, exercise, online chess) has almost no marginal cost (in terms of money).
    Also, we know that lots of people find fulfillment in their work or other activities that aren't usually considered leisure such as activism or art, where you're producing something, and you gain utility based on what you've produced and not the time spent doing it (whereas in conventional models, spending time on leisure itself is the reward). <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, in my model, individuals maximize the <i>amount</i> of fulfilling work they get done, subject to time and tiredness constraints. 
    Tiredness here refers to the phenomenon where I get tired after working for a while, and my productivity decreases. To maximize the total amount of work I get done I need to rest. This can be applied to traditional leisure activities as well: I can't go snowboarding all day long because I'll get tired. 
    This is somewhat similar to standard macro models where the population (agent) allocates money (time) between consumption (producing fulfilling work now) or investment (sleeping so they will be more productive tomorrow). 
    The key difference here is that there is no clear functional form for resting (whereas capital next period = capital now + investment - depreciation) and that there is an upper limit to how productive someone can get. 
    I model that using an "efficiency percentage", where the total amount of work someone gets done over time is proportional to the integral of their efficiency percentage over the period of time that they are working. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this is where my thinking sort of ended and I don't know where to go...</i>
