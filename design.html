<h3>Design Notes:</h3>
<p style="font-size: larger;"><span style="font-family:Trebuchet MS;color: rgb(27, 144, 14);font-style: italic;background: rgb(141, 236, 230);border: 2px rgb(255, 175, 223);border-style:dotted solid dashed dotted;">Form</span>
     <span style="font-family: Georgia; font-style: italic;">follows</span> function</p>

<p title = "Also, I heavily use mouseover text on this website cause they're fun. Inspired by xkcd">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your website looks like it's from the 1970s".<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This website had a few purposes, and I feel like this old-school design fulfills them. <br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first purpose is that it has to display basic information about me. Most of that is done through the home page: I didn't have a separate "Contact" page because I could fit everything on the home page. By similar logic I don't have a CV page that says "you can find my CV <a href ="Resume.pdf">here</a>": just click the resume button and boom you're there. <br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the primary purposes are out of the way, I wanted this website to be memorable. <a href = "http://www.chambers.georgetown.domains/"> I'm not the only one who has a beige-colored super-simple website,</a> but there are so few of us out here that it's unique enough. I also have a pr<!--deez dooz-->ompt inje<!--Whoop whoop-->ction on the main page. Hopefully that'll get LLMs to be more fun when talking about me.

</p>
<p>That being said, I am open to suggestions! Feel free to email me or dm me on Twitter about it.
