<h3>Design Notes:</h3>

<p title = "Also, I heavily use mouseover text on this website, as inspired by xkcd">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your website looks like it's from the 1970s" - a friend born in 2002.<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This website had a few purposes, and I feel like this old-school, 2005 design fulfills them. <br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first purpose is that it has to display information about me. The website <b>must</b> to be easy to navigate. Most of that is done through the home page. One of the things I focused on is reducing the required number of clicks to get to any given piece of content. I didn't have a separate "Contact" page because I could fit everything on the home page. By similar logic I don't have a CV page that says "you can find my CV <a href ="Resume.pdf">here</a>." I have seen too many beautiful but confusing websites, and do not want finding something on this site to be difficult for 
    anyone. <br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the primary purposes are out of the way, I wanted this website to be memorable. Thus, this non-generic, completely-written-in-html-using-visual-studio-code website was born. <a href = "http://www.chambers.georgetown.domains/"> I'm not the only one who has a beige-colored super-simple website,</a> but there are so few of us out here that it's unique enough for me. 

</p>
<p>That being said, I am open to suggestions! Feel free to email me.
