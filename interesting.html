<h4><i>Books</i></h4>

<p>I am currently reading <i>Career and Family</i> and <i>The Genetic Lottery: Why DNA matters for social equality</i>. I recommend both books. A quick note about <i>Career and Family</i> though: It seemed to focus overwhelmingly on the lives affluent women. (Though I haven't finished the book yet) This is still a fascinating subject, but readers should know that <a href = "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/04/upshot/up-birth-age-gap.html"> a lot of American Women</a> are still having children before they are 24. </p>

<p title = "Life changing book numbero dos"> 
    I really enjoyed <a href = 'https://www.amazon.com/WEIRDest-People-World-Psychologically-Particularly/dp/1250800072/' target = "_blank">The WEIRDest People in the World</a> by Joseph Henrich <br>
    This is one of my favorite and most recommended books about society. Studying and understanding societies is a lifelong goal of mine, and 
    the author looks at how cultural norms, views, and psychological tendencies developed and competed against each other. There's lots of anthropology stuff but also no shortage of rigor and econometrics.<br>
    The book talks a lot about things I've read elsewhere and generally supports their findings. Specifically, both this and 
    <i><a href = "https://www.amazon.com/Long-Road-Industrial-Revolution-perspective/dp/9004175172" target="_blank">The Long Road to the Industrial Revolution</a></i> talks about the marriage pattern (what Henrich
    calls the marriage family program) and its impact on society. Both this book and <i>Why nations fail</i> look at the effect of institutions on societies (which includes their economy).<br>

<p><a href = "https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html"target = "_blank">R for Data Science</a>. Great introduction to R. However I would actually recommend first learning a bit of base R before using this book. 
    Any random base R course is fine.
    This book dives straight into tidyverse and while I think tibbles > data frames and ggplot2 > base R plots, it's better to know some basic R stuff before looking at this book. At least know what View() does.

mature (thanks in part to <a href = "https://www.whitman.edu/mathematics/higher_math_online/" target = "_blank">Introduction to Higher mathematics</a>), it's clear to me that this book is one of the best 
resources out there to really understand Linear Algebra. For <b>more fun</b>, pair this book with course notes from <a href = "https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/75936/assignments/syllabus" target = "_blank">55a</a>  </p>

<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09375" target="_blank">Basic Category Theory</a>. I haven't taken real math classes in a while now. Reading this book really reminded me of how fun math is. I've been wanting to learn more about Category theory since like Summer of 2021 and this is so far the easiest book on it that I can find and one where I can actually sort of follow along :)</p>
