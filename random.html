<p><a href = "https://cbt-t.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/home" target="_blank">Cognitive behavioural therapy in ten sessions for patients with non-underweight eating disorders.</a> Excellent resources for those struggling with eating disorders. The therapy manual, though designed for therapists, can be used as a self-help guide. (Although the main author, Glenn Waller, has also published an explicit <a href = "https://www.amazon.com/Beating-Your-Eating-Disorder-Cognitive-Behavioral/dp/0521739047/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=" target="_blank"> self-help guide</a>, I would recommend reading the therapy manual as well since the self-help book is over ten years old and doesn't draw on the latest research).
