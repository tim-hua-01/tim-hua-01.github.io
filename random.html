<h3>AI Safety Resources</h3>

<p>
    The <a href="https://arena-chapter0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/" target="_blank">ARENA curriculum</a> is the best intro/resource for technical AI safety research. The main overview class for the whole field is <a href="https://bluedot.org/courses/alignment" target="_blank">AI safety fundamentals</a>. The best way to learn about opportunities in the field is by subscribing to the <a href="https://jobs.80000hours.org/?int_campaign=primary-navigation" target="_blank">80000 hours job board</a>. <a href="https://www.aisafety.com/map" target="_blank">The AIsafety.com map</a> also has a bunch of fun links.
</p>

<p>
    I'm now including a bunch of links to things, but honestly, you don't need to read all of them or even be aware of them to do good work/get started in the field. But there is a lot of lore out there, and I've picked out my personal favorite collection. When I got started I spent a ton of time hungrily going through them and feeling both overwhelmed and fascinated. They can be fun to read, but it's hard to feel like you're making actual progress if you're just reading stuff, so I'd prioritize working through the ARENA curriculum or AI safety fundamentals.
</p>

<p>
    To get a sense of what people are working on now, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Wti4Wr7Cf5ma3FGWa/shallow-review-of-technical-ai-safety-2025-2" target="_blank">there's an overview post</a> from the end of 2025, and you can also check out what mentors in <a href="https://sparai.org/projects" target="_blank">SPAR</a> and <a href="https://www.matsprogram.org/apply" target="_blank">MATS</a> are interested in.
</p>

<h4>Current Research Areas</h4>

<h4>Additional Reading</h4>
<p>
    There's a lot of literature out there scattered across LessWrong and other places. A hodge podge of things that I think are worth skimming/reading:
</p>

</ul>
<p>(Obviously I don't endorse all of these, in fact they contradict each other)</p>

<h4>Earlier Curriculums</h4>
<p>
    There are also earlier "overview of AI safety" curriculums from <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HGzMBMXQD9w9K32scqCoSmZNGbxLJE8-siPlonTQz6s/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">PIBBSS</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mTm_sT2YQx3mRXQD6J2xD2QJG1c3kHyvX8kQc_IQ0ns/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.dlm795ug69gc" target="_blank">Richard Ngo</a> or <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IziNp1XHLrv5yKEUqGkGlMkwrxJ2SsfCLawIdFMMfNw/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.dlm795ug69gc" target="_blank">Eleuther</a> which are more conceptual than empirical. For what it's worth, I think people should read more theory. Even if some of the theories turn out to be wrong, it's good to think them through.

<p><a href = "https://cbt-t.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/home" target="_blank">Cognitive behavioural therapy in ten sessions for patients with non-underweight eating disorders.</a> Excellent resources for those struggling with eating disorders. The therapy manual, though designed for therapists, can be used as a self-help guide. (Although the main author, Glenn Waller, has also published an explicit <a href = "https://www.amazon.com/Beating-Your-Eating-Disorder-Cognitive-Behavioral/dp/0521739047/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=" target="_blank"> self-help guide</a>, I would recommend reading the therapy manual as well since the self-help book is over ten years old and doesn't draw on the latest research).
